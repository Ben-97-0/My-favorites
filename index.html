      I like fishing because it is fun and relaxing. it is also very simple to
      learn and it does not require very much effort. My favorite fish to catch

      because of it not needing bait and being close to Edmonton.

      because it is fun but, i am not very good at it and have not played it for
      a while it is also relaxing to play and is something to do if you are
      bored

      I like camping because it lets you be in nature. Camping also means you
      will most likely go fishing which i also like.
